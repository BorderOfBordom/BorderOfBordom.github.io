<h1>Robotics</h1>
<h2>Freshman Year</h2>
<h3>In freshman year, I was on two robotics teams, 750B and 750K.</h3>
<h4>What have I done on 750B?</h4>
<ul>
  <li>I created the original code for the first iteration of our robot. The code was full of bugs and was a good learning experience.</li>
  <li>I also helped make the final code for the robot. I made sure that I fixed the mistakes that I had made before.</li>
  <li>I have been to most of the competitions for 750B.</li>
</ul>
<h4>What have I done for 750K?</h4>
<ul>
  <li>I created the original code for the first robot we made. I made sure that I didn't make the same mistakes that I had make on 750B. I also helped build the first iteration of the robot</li>
  <li>I make the final code for the robot. Since it was an edited version of the first code, all I did was fix some controls and made a autonomous code for the bot.</li>
</ul>
